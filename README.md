Description- Our idea behind this project was to design an app to help people share produce from their garden.
We wanted to build a "farmers market" style of app.


Motivation - Our motivation was to build a functional app within two weeks. The project solves the issue of people either having
an over abundance of egg plants, or people requiring fresh jalepenos for their salsa.

Results- The end results, the app works!

Team work- Anthony F and Telahoun worked the back end making sure that the app functions properly.
    - Anthony M and Emma worked on the front end making sure the app is appealing to the eye.

Challenges-

Improvements-

As far as improvements go, we'd like to work on user authentication, and email notifications.
